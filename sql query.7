7.	Consider the following database Project(project_id,proj_name,chief_arch) , project_id is primary key Employee(Emp_id,Emp_name) , Emp_id is primary key
Assigned-To(Project_id,Emp_id)

Find the SQL queries for the following:

1.	Get the details of employees working on project C353
2.	Get employee number of employees working on project C353
3.	Obtain details of employees working on Database project
4.	Get details of employees working on both C353 and C354
5.	Get employee numbers of employees who do not work on project C453


CREATE TABLE Project (
    project_id VARCHAR(5) PRIMARY KEY,
    proj_name VARCHAR(50),
    chief_arch VARCHAR(50)
);


CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Emp_name VARCHAR(50)
);


CREATE TABLE Assigned_To (
    Project_id VARCHAR(5),
    Emp_id INT);


INSERT INTO Project VALUES ('C353', 'Project C353', 'Chief C353');
INSERT INTO Project VALUES ('C354', 'Project C354', 'Chief C354');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (1, 'Employee 1');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (2, 'Employee 2');
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES (3, 'Employee 3');
INSERT INTO Assigned_To VALUES ('C353', 1);
INSERT INTO Assigned_To VALUES ('C353', 2);
INSERT INTO Assigned_To VALUES ('C354', 2);
INSERT INTO Assigned_To VALUES ('C354', 3);



1.Get the details of employees working on project C353:
SELECT E.Emp_id, E.Emp_name
FROM Employee E
JOIN Assigned_To A ON E.Emp_id = A.Emp_id
WHERE A.Project_id = 'C353';

2.Get employee number of employees working on project C353:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS EmployeeCount
FROM Employee E
JOIN Assigned_To A ON E.Emp_id = A.Emp_id
WHERE A.Project_id = 'C353';

3.3.	Obtain details of employees working on Database project
SELECT E.Emp_id, E.Emp_name
FROM Employee E
JOIN Assigned_To A ON E.Emp_id = A.Emp_id
JOIN Project P ON A.Project_id = P.project_id
WHERE P.proj_name = 'Database project';

4.	Get details of employees working on both C353 and C354
SELECT E.Emp_id, E.Emp_name
FROM Employee E
JOIN Assigned_To A1 ON E.Emp_id = A1.Emp_id
JOIN Assigned_To A2 ON E.Emp_id = A2.Emp_id
WHERE A1.Project_id = 'C353' AND A2.Project_id = 'C354';
